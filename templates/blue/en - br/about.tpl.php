								<p>Server work on a full Season 12 Part 1-2 Emulator with our custom settings and features. All our events work, from the well-known Blood Castle, to the novelties of season 12 - updated Ferea and Nixies Lake. In addition, for most of our events, top system works just perfectly fine, succeeding in which player will be reward with w coins. Furthermore, our customised Socket, Elemental and Muun system works absolutely fine. If you are a beginner or have played on the old seasons, any information regarding to the game content can be found <a href="https://NewAgeZ.com/index.php?/forum/10-general-guides/">here</a>.</p>

							<font size="4">Locations and monsters</font>
							<div class="justify">
								<p>We have access to all WebZen locations. On locations, where WebZen have only a few or doesn’t have any monsters, we have added more of them, however it doesn’t mean that there will be spots. Monsters are evenly distributed across the locations and set up, so that players won't be spending too much time on their search.</p>

							<br>
							<font size="4">Items and their options</font>
							<div class="justify">
								<p>Our items are completely from Season 12 Part 1-2. Slight changes have been done towards few options. The actual value of damage decrease on the excellent gear is + 5%. In similar way, harmony and socket options were slightly changed. In addition, we have slightly redesigned classical ancient set item options, in order to increase their characteristics a bit.</p>

							<br>
							<font size="4">Economics and donations</font>
							<div class="justify">
								<p>The economy is built on the basic currency - w coins. It is most valuable currency, as only with w coins you can purchase items in cash shop and spend it on our services. You can earn w coins in variety of ways - by voting, deals on the market, selling character on the auction house, participating in events, reaching your place in various top lists and of course by donating. Speaking about donations, it’s worth mentioning that it does not play a decisive role in the gameplay. If you are an active player, you will be able to quickly catch your donator opponents (and if you’re skilled, you’ll be able to achieve superiority over them!). Apart from w coins as a barter currency, zen and jewels can be used. Zen is required mainly for technical services, as upgrading items, crafting, buying potions, making resets etc. however despite of that it has a certain value. Jewels are also used in the game as a trading currency, directly making transactions with other players. For that, we advice you to use offtrade, as you can easily sell your items while being offline.</p>
